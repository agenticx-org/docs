# API Overview

## Introduction

The API is used internally by the application and is streamed to the UI via Websockets. It recieves events
from the client, which are expected to be text input, and it outputs structured content ready to add to your report.

The main functions are:

1. Web search with deep research - does a web search.
 * Text based
 * Structured data input - e.g. tables 
 * Produces markdown output
2. Data scientist in a box - runs python code to perform analysis on your data.
 * Uses smolagents (https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)
 * Is like a Jupyter notebook in the output
 * Forecasting is supported
 * Multi-linear regression for correlation is also supported
 * Is skilled at value_counts and histograms
3. Internal data search with deep research - does an internal search.
 * The same as 1. and 2. except a different Tool is provided to the data search to search internal data
 * The internal data source initially supported is an object store or file share
 * Supports searching unstructured text files, excel files, and csv files
 * Unstructured text is available as RAG
